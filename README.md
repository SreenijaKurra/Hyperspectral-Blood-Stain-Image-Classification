  Hyperspectral Imaging for Blood Stain Identification in Forensic Science
</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
  This project highlights the potential of hyperspectral imaging as a non-invasive technique for identifying and classifying blood stains in forensic science, eliminating the need for physical sampling of critical evidence. Traditional chemical processes used for blood identification and classification often compromise subsequent DNA analysis, necessitating the exploration of innovative methods. However, developing robust algorithms for blood detection using hyperspectral imaging is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of training samples.

  To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel hyperspectral blood detection dataset and investigates eight dimensionality reduction techniques as preprocessing methods. These methods are evaluated using state-of-the-art fast and compact 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Hybrid CNN models. Experimental results underscore the complexities involved in hyperspectral blood detection and suggest avenues for future research. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the value of <strong style="color: #4CAF50;">Factor Analysis</strong> as a statistical approach to uncover underlying factors explaining the patterns and relationships among observed variables.
